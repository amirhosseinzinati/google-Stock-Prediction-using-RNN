# google-Stuck-Prediction-using-RNN
This project utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict Google's stock prices. The model is trained on historical stock price data and aims to forecast future prices based on patterns observed in the data.
# Introduction

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks particularly suited for sequence data, such as time series. They have internal memory that allows them to retain information about previous inputs, making them ideal for tasks like stock price prediction. In this project, we train an RNN to predict Google's stock prices using historical data.
# Dataset

The dataset consists of historical stock prices for Google (GOOGL). It includes daily closing prices, as well as other features such as opening prices, highest prices of the day, lowest prices of the day, and volume of stocks traded.
